# Changelog

Semver. Changing a token's value is a minor. Removing a token, renaming a
class, or changing what a function returns is a major.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-20

- The bar wears GateIron.com's own translucent paper tone over a blur, not a
  flat surface colour. `--bar-bg` overrides it.
- The footer is pinned to the end of the page: `body` is a flex column,
  `main` grows, so a short page still ends with the footer at the bottom of
  the window and a long one pushes it below the fold.
- `h1` is 2rem, and `.subtitle` is the large secondary line under it.
- `.field-pair` puts two fields on one line and drops to one when narrow.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-20

**Breaking.** The dark theme is now opt-in, the bar and footer changed shape,
and a site that is not GateIron.com must say so.

- `topBar({ mark })` — raw HTML for the product's own mark, `'gate'` for
  GateIron's, `null` for none. Defaults to `'gate'`, so GateIron needs no
  argument and every other site must pass one.
- `siteFooter` now renders GateIron's own footer: the company block with the
  light mark, name and locality on the left, links on the right, fine print
  under a rule. `brand` overrides it, `brand: null` omits it. `byline` is gone;
  `finePrint` takes an array.
- Light unless asked. `page({ darkMode: 'auto' })` adds `.gi-dark-auto` to
  `<html>` and honours the system preference. Anything relying on dark by
  default loses it.
- Bar and footer metrics are GateIron's: 1140px shell, 28px gutters, 40px mark,
  39px avatar, 14px bar padding.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-20

Editorial pass over every comment and document in the repository.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

First release, extracted from NotUserError.

- Palette (paper, ink, clay, pine, ochre), light and dark.
- Fraunces and Hanken Grotesk, self-hosted, with their OFL texts.
- `topBar`, `siteFooter`, `page`, `initials`, `assetUrl`, `esc`.
- Buttons, forms, cards, notices, tables, status and priority badges, the
  account menu.
- Two densities: the default and `gi-compact`.
- Classroom footer variant.

Changed from the NotUserError original:

- Functions take plain data, never an Express `req`.
- CommonJS, with a statically analysable `module.exports`.
- `avatar.is-admin` became `avatar.is-accent`. A role is the consumer's
  vocabulary.
- The stylesheet moved in beside the fonts it references, so one static mount
  serves the package.
